## ⚡ The Hook: A Predator in the Shadows

## ⚔️ Key Battle Moments: The High Orc Ambush
The raid takes a lethal turn when the team is ambushed by High Orcs. While Captain **Son Ki-Hoon** fights valiantly, the sheer numbers are overwhelming. 

**What you missed:**
* **The Perception Gap:** S-Rank Hunter **Cha Hae-In** is the only one who senses the chilling aura emanating from Jin-Woo, signaling that his facade is starting to crack.
* **Invisible Assistance:** Using his **Stealth** ability, Jin-Woo subtly eliminates key threats, allowing the exhausted team to survive a massacre they didn't even see coming.
